# Assignment 0 - distributed in Github Repo e4040-2020Fall-assign0
The assignment is distributed as a jupyter notebook called Assignment 0.ipynb from a github repository (or as a zip file). Additional instructions and support material for the assignment can be found in file README.md which comes with the assignment and in a set of webpages under https://ecbme4040.github.io/2020_fall/index.html. The assignment uses TensorFlow version 2.2.

The simplest way to initially see the content of the jupyter notebook file Assignment 0.ipynb is to use Google Colab in the cloud: (i) Use your UNI@columbia.edu account to log into the Colab (https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/intro.ipynb); (ii) Upload Assignment 0.ipynb, explore and run the file.

For students who are formally registered into this class at the end of the add/drop period, the assignment requires that students complete the tasks from this Jupyter Notebook while running it on the Google Cloud (GCP) custom image (not Colab, Colab is only a temporary execution method).

Detailed instructions how to submit this assignement/homework will be posted after the add/drop period.
